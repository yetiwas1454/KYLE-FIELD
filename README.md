Kyle Field Data Analysis

Overview
This document outlines the work done on the Kyle field dataset, focusing on the preparation, analysis, and visualization of data.

Key Activities:

Dataset Preparation and Collection
- Initiated the preparation and collection of the dataset for Material Balance through MBAL.
- Gathered and compiled all available datasets and documented their usage. Started conducting the material balance analysis for the Kyle oil field.
- Worked on preparing the pressure data for the Kyle field.
- Prepared the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) format dataset for the Kyle field.
  
Data Analysis and Visualization
- Created a Python plot visualizing data for the Kyle field.
- Completed dataset plotting with Python and included the Kyle field in a presentation covering open-source datasets from various oil fields.
- Created a Pivot table for the Kyle field and started working on an interactive dashboard.
- Finished the dashboard for the Kyle field.
- Completed dashboards for five fields, including Kyle, and compiled the reservoir parameters and well data in Excel format.
- Compiled data for the Kyle field in Excel and corrected dashboards.
  
Further Analysis and Data Acquisition
- Studied the Kyle field and aimed to obtain log data and perforation data for remaining wells.
- Obtained well log data for two exploratory wells and found new parameters for the Kyle field.
  
Tools and Techniques
- Python: Used for plotting and data visualization.
- Excel: Compiled reservoir parameters and well data.
- Interactive Dashboards: Created for a comprehensive view of the Kyle field data.

Future Work
- Further study and analysis to obtain additional log data and perforation data for the remaining wells.
- Continual refinement of dashboards and data visualization for improved insights.
